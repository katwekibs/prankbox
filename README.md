# prankbox
Prank box is a pranking app to make non-receivable prank call to any phone number in the world, that looks like is coming from any number of your choice.

Calls made from PrankBox are non receivable, meaning all you get, is phone rings on the receiving end, but once the receiver picks up, the call is dropped.

PrankBox is not a call spoofing app. PrankBox is for entertainment use only. NO real conversation is enabled from Prank
